Usually, image cleaning process takes about 10 - 13 seconds. It is quite long comparing to the whole process. But if we can run it on HTC, the efficiency will greatly enhance.

The time of OCR process depends on how much content on each page. Some pages are full of words, which may take 30 seconds or more per page. Some pages with less words to read may only take 2 - 4 seconds. The resolution of one page may also affect OCR's speed.

Converting PDF to images usually takes less than 0.002 seconds, so it is too quick to take into account.
